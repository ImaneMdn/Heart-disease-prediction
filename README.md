# Heart-disease-prediction

## Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading global cause of mortality, responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths annually. Identifying individuals at risk of heart disease is crucial for early intervention. This project aims to leverage machine learning to assist in the early identification of potential heart disease cases.

## Dataset

The dataset, obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)., comprises 11 features that provide valuable insights for predicting heart disease.
The dataset comprises 11 features that provide valuable insights for predicting heart disease. These features include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment.

## Models
Several machine learning models have been developed to predict whether a person has heart disease or not. The models utilize the provided attributes to make accurate predictions, aiding in early detection and proactive healthcare management.

## Observations and Statistics
In addition to the machine learning models, various statistical analyses and observations have been conducted on the dataset. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between different attributes and their impact on predicting heart disease.

## Conclusion
This repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring machine learning approaches for heart disease prediction. The provided models and analyses contribute to the ongoing efforts in leveraging technology to improve cardiovascular health outcomes.
